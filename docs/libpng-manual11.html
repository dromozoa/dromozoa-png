<h1>XI. Changes to Libpng from version 1.4.x to 1.5.x</h1>

<pre>XI.  Changes to Libpng from version 1.4.x to 1.5.x

From libpng-1.4.0 until 1.4.4, the <a href="png.h.html#L2576">png_get_uint_16</a> macro (but not the
function) incorrectly returned a value of type png_uint_32.
The incorrect macro was removed from libpng-1.4.5.

Checking for invalid palette index on write was added at libpng
1.5.10.  If a pixel contains an invalid (out-of-range) index libpng issues
a benign error.  This is enabled by default because this condition is an
error according to the PNG specification, Clause 11.3.2, but the error can
be ignored in each png_ptr with

   <a href="png.h.html#L2643">png_set_check_for_invalid_index</a>(png_ptr, allowed);

      allowed  - one of
                 0: disable benign error (accept the
                    invalid data without warning).
                 1: enable benign error (treat the
                    invalid data as an error or a
                    warning).

If the error is ignored, or if <a href="png.h.html#L1835">png_benign_error</a>() treats it as a warning,
any invalid pixels are decoded as opaque black by the decoder and written
as-is by the encoder.

Retrieving the maximum palette index found was added at libpng-1.5.15.
This statement must appear after <a href="png.h.html#L2352">png_read_png</a>() or <a href="png.h.html#L1415">png_read_image</a>() while
reading, and after <a href="png.h.html#L2356">png_write_png</a>() or <a href="png.h.html#L1431">png_write_image</a>() while writing.

   int max_palette = <a href="png.h.html#L2646">png_get_palette_max</a>(png_ptr, info_ptr);

This will return the maximum palette index found in the image, or "-1" if
the palette was not checked, or "0" if no palette was found.  Note that this
does not account for any palette index used by ancillary chunks such as the
bKGD chunk; you must check those separately to determine the maximum
palette index actually used.

There are no substantial API changes between the non-deprecated parts of
the 1.4.5 API and the 1.5.0 API; however, the ability to directly access
members of the main libpng control structures, png_struct and png_info,
deprecated in earlier versions of libpng, has been completely removed from
libpng 1.5, and new private "pngstruct.h", "pnginfo.h", and "pngdebug.h"
header files were created.

We no longer include zlib.h in png.h.  The include statement has been moved
to pngstruct.h, where it is not accessible by applications. Applications that
need access to information in zlib.h will need to add the '#include "zlib.h"'
directive.  It does not matter whether this is placed prior to or after
the '"#include png.h"' directive.

The png_sprintf(), png_strcpy(), and png_strncpy() macros are no longer used
and were removed.

We moved the png_strlen(), png_memcpy(), png_memset(), and png_memcmp()
macros into a private header file (pngpriv.h) that is not accessible to
applications.

In <a href="png.h.html#L2121">png_get_iCCP</a>, the type of "profile" was changed from png_charpp
to png_bytepp, and in <a href="png.h.html#L2127">png_set_iCCP</a>, from png_charp to png_const_bytep.

There are changes of form in png.h, including new and changed macros to
declare parts of the API.  Some API functions with arguments that are
pointers to data not modified within the function have been corrected to
declare these arguments with PNG_CONST.

Much of the internal use of C macros to control the library build has also
changed and some of this is visible in the exported header files, in
particular the use of macros to control data and API elements visible
during application compilation may require significant revision to
application code.  (It is extremely rare for an application to do this.)

Any program that compiled against libpng 1.4 and did not use deprecated
features or access internal library structures should compile and work
against libpng 1.5, except for the change in the prototype for
<a href="png.h.html#L2121">png_get_iCCP</a>() and <a href="png.h.html#L2127">png_set_iCCP</a>() API functions mentioned above.

libpng 1.5.0 adds PNG_ PASS macros to help in the reading and writing of
interlaced images.  The macros return the number of rows and columns in
each pass and information that can be used to de-interlace and (if
absolutely necessary) interlace an image.

libpng 1.5.0 adds an API png_longjmp(png_ptr, value).  This API calls
the application-provided png_longjmp_ptr on the internal, but application
initialized, longjmp buffer.  It is provided as a convenience to avoid
the need to use the png_jmpbuf macro, which had the unnecessary side
effect of resetting the internal png_longjmp_ptr value.

libpng 1.5.0 includes a complete fixed point API.  By default this is
present along with the corresponding floating point API.  In general the
fixed point API is faster and smaller than the floating point one because
the PNG file format used fixed point, not floating point.  This applies
even if the library uses floating point in internal calculations.  A new
macro, PNG_FLOATING_ARITHMETIC_SUPPORTED, reveals whether the library
uses floating point arithmetic (the default) or fixed point arithmetic
internally for performance critical calculations such as gamma correction.
In some cases, the gamma calculations may produce slightly different
results.  This has changed the results in png_rgb_to_gray and in alpha
composition (<a href="png.h.html#L1330">png_set_background</a> for example). This applies even if the
original image was already linear (gamma == 1.0) and, therefore, it is
not necessary to linearize the image.  This is because libpng has *not*
been changed to optimize that case correctly, yet.

Fixed point support for the sCAL chunk comes with an important caveat;
the sCAL specification uses a decimal encoding of floating point values
and the accuracy of PNG fixed point values is insufficient for
representation of these values. Consequently a "string" API
(<a href="png.h.html#L2196">png_get_sCAL_s</a> and <a href="png.h.html#L2205">png_set_sCAL_s</a>) is the only reliable way of reading
arbitrary sCAL chunks in the absence of either the floating point API or
internal floating point calculations.  Starting with libpng-1.5.0, both
of these functions are present when PNG_sCAL_SUPPORTED is defined.  Prior
to libpng-1.5.0, their presence also depended upon PNG_FIXED_POINT_SUPPORTED
being defined and PNG_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORTED not being defined.

Applications no longer need to include the optional distribution header
file pngusr.h or define the corresponding macros during application
build in order to see the correct variant of the libpng API.  From 1.5.0
application code can check for the corresponding _SUPPORTED macro:

#ifdef PNG_INCH_CONVERSIONS_SUPPORTED
   /* code that uses the inch conversion APIs. */
#endif

This macro will only be defined if the inch conversion functions have been
compiled into libpng.  The full set of macros, and whether or not support
has been compiled in, are available in the header file pnglibconf.h.
This header file is specific to the libpng build.  Notice that prior to
1.5.0 the _SUPPORTED macros would always have the default definition unless
reset by pngusr.h or by explicit settings on the compiler command line.
These settings may produce compiler warnings or errors in 1.5.0 because
of macro redefinition.

Applications can now choose whether to use these macros or to call the
corresponding function by defining PNG_USE_READ_MACROS or
PNG_NO_USE_READ_MACROS before including png.h.  Notice that this is
only supported from 1.5.0; defining PNG_NO_USE_READ_MACROS prior to 1.5.0
will lead to a link failure.

Prior to libpng-1.5.4, the zlib compressor used the same set of parameters
when compressing the IDAT data and textual data such as zTXt and iCCP.
In libpng-1.5.4 we reinitialized the zlib stream for each type of data.
We added five png_set_text_*() functions for setting the parameters to
use with textual data.

Prior to libpng-1.5.4, the PNG_READ_16_TO_8_ACCURATE_SCALE_SUPPORTED
option was off by default, and slightly inaccurate scaling occurred.
This option can no longer be turned off, and the choice of accurate
or inaccurate 16-to-8 scaling is by using the new png_set_scale_16_to_8()
API for accurate scaling or the old png_set_strip_16_to_8() API for simple
chopping.  In libpng-1.5.4, the PNG_READ_16_TO_8_ACCURATE_SCALE_SUPPORTED
macro became PNG_READ_SCALE_16_TO_8_SUPPORTED, and the PNG_READ_16_TO_8
macro became PNG_READ_STRIP_16_TO_8_SUPPORTED, to enable the two
png_set_*_16_to_8() functions separately.

Prior to libpng-1.5.4, the <a href="png.h.html#L2392">png_set_user_limits</a>() function could only be
used to reduce the width and height limits from the value of
PNG_USER_WIDTH_MAX and PNG_USER_HEIGHT_MAX, although this document said
that it could be used to override them.  Now this function will reduce or
increase the limits.

Starting in libpng-1.5.22, default user limits were established. These
can be overridden by application calls to <a href="png.h.html#L2392">png_set_user_limits</a>(),
png_set_user_chunk_cache_max(), and/or png_set_user_malloc_max().
The limits are now
                             max possible  default
   png_user_width_max        0x7fffffff    1,000,000
   png_user_height_max       0x7fffffff    1,000,000
   png_user_chunk_cache_max  0 (unlimited) 1000
   png_user_chunk_malloc_max 0 (unlimited) 8,000,000

The <a href="png.h.html#L3253">png_set_option</a>() function (and the "options" member of the png struct) was
added to libpng-1.5.15, with option <a href="png.h.html#L3234">PNG_ARM_NEON</a>.

The library now supports a complete fixed point implementation and can
thus be used on systems that have no floating point support or very
limited or slow support.  Previously gamma correction, an essential part
of complete PNG support, required reasonably fast floating point.

As part of this the choice of internal implementation has been made
independent of the choice of fixed versus floating point APIs and all the
missing fixed point APIs have been implemented.

The exact mechanism used to control attributes of API functions has
changed, as described in the INSTALL file.

A new test program, pngvalid, is provided in addition to pngtest.
pngvalid validates the arithmetic accuracy of the gamma correction
calculations and includes a number of validations of the file format.
A subset of the full range of tests is run when "make check" is done
(in the 'configure' build.)  pngvalid also allows total allocated memory
usage to be evaluated and performs additional memory overwrite validation.

Many changes to individual feature macros have been made. The following
are the changes most likely to be noticed by library builders who
configure libpng:

1) All feature macros now have consistent naming:

#define PNG_NO_feature turns the feature off
#define PNG_feature_SUPPORTED turns the feature on

pnglibconf.h contains one line for each feature macro which is either:

#define PNG_feature_SUPPORTED

if the feature is supported or:

/*#undef PNG_feature_SUPPORTED*/

if it is not.  Library code consistently checks for the 'SUPPORTED' macro.
It does not, and libpng applications should not, check for the 'NO' macro
which will not normally be defined even if the feature is not supported.
The 'NO' macros are only used internally for setting or not setting the
corresponding 'SUPPORTED' macros.

Compatibility with the old names is provided as follows:

PNG_INCH_CONVERSIONS turns on PNG_INCH_CONVERSIONS_SUPPORTED

And the following definitions disable the corresponding feature:

PNG_SETJMP_NOT_SUPPORTED disables SETJMP
PNG_READ_TRANSFORMS_NOT_SUPPORTED disables READ_TRANSFORMS
PNG_NO_READ_COMPOSITED_NODIV disables READ_COMPOSITE_NODIV
PNG_WRITE_TRANSFORMS_NOT_SUPPORTED disables WRITE_TRANSFORMS
PNG_READ_ANCILLARY_CHUNKS_NOT_SUPPORTED disables READ_ANCILLARY_CHUNKS
PNG_WRITE_ANCILLARY_CHUNKS_NOT_SUPPORTED disables WRITE_ANCILLARY_CHUNKS

Library builders should remove use of the above, inconsistent, names.

2) Warning and error message formatting was previously conditional on
the STDIO feature. The library has been changed to use the
CONSOLE_IO feature instead. This means that if CONSOLE_IO is disabled
the library no longer uses the printf(3) functions, even though the
default read/write implementations use (FILE) style stdio.h functions.

3) Three feature macros now control the fixed/floating point decisions:

PNG_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORTED enables the floating point APIs

PNG_FIXED_POINT_SUPPORTED enables the fixed point APIs; however, in
practice these are normally required internally anyway (because the PNG
file format is fixed point), therefore in most cases PNG_NO_FIXED_POINT
merely stops the function from being exported.

PNG_FLOATING_ARITHMETIC_SUPPORTED chooses between the internal floating
point implementation or the fixed point one.  Typically the fixed point
implementation is larger and slower than the floating point implementation
on a system that supports floating point; however, it may be faster on a
system which lacks floating point hardware and therefore uses a software
emulation.

4) Added PNG_{READ,WRITE}_INT_FUNCTIONS_SUPPORTED.  This allows the
functions to read and write ints to be disabled independently of
PNG_USE_READ_MACROS, which allows libpng to be built with the functions
even though the default is to use the macros - this allows applications
to choose at app buildtime whether or not to use macros (previously
impossible because the functions weren't in the default build.)

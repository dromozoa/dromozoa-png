<h1>XII. Changes to Libpng from version 1.5.x to 1.6.x</h1>

<pre>XII.  Changes to Libpng from version 1.5.x to 1.6.x

A "simplified API" has been added (see documentation in png.h and a simple
example in contrib/examples/pngtopng.c).  The new publicly visible API
includes the following:

   macros:
     PNG_FORMAT_*
     PNG_IMAGE_*
   structures:
     png_control
     png_image
   read functions
     <a href="png.h.html#L3011">png_image_begin_read_from_file</a>()
     <a href="png.h.html#L3017">png_image_begin_read_from_stdio</a>()
     <a href="png.h.html#L3022">png_image_begin_read_from_memory</a>()
     <a href="png.h.html#L3026">png_image_finish_read</a>()
     <a href="png.h.html#L3061">png_image_free</a>()
   write functions
     <a href="png.h.html#L3085">png_image_write_to_file</a>()
     <a href="png.h.html#L3117">png_image_write_to_memory</a>()
     <a href="png.h.html#L3090">png_image_write_to_stdio</a>()

Starting with libpng-1.6.0, you can configure libpng to prefix all exported
symbols, using the PNG_PREFIX macro.

We no longer include string.h in png.h.  The include statement has been moved
to pngpriv.h, where it is not accessible by applications.  Applications that
need access to information in string.h must add an '#include &lt;string.h&gt;'
directive.  It does not matter whether this is placed prior to or after
the '#include "png.h"' directive.

The following API are now DEPRECATED:
   png_info_init_3()
   png_convert_to_rfc1123() which has been replaced
     with <a href="png.h.html#L1067">png_convert_to_rfc1123_buffer</a>()
   png_malloc_default()
   png_free_default()
   png_reset_zstream()

The following have been removed:
   png_get_io_chunk_name(), which has been replaced
     with <a href="png.h.html#L2449">png_get_io_chunk_type</a>().  The new
     function returns a 32-bit integer instead of
     a string.
   The png_sizeof(), png_strlen(), png_memcpy(), png_memcmp(), and
     png_memset() macros are no longer used in the libpng sources and
     have been removed.  These had already been made invisible to applications
     (i.e., defined in the private pngpriv.h header file) since libpng-1.5.0.

The signatures of many exported functions were changed, such that
   png_structp became png_structrp or png_const_structrp
   png_infop became png_inforp or png_const_inforp
where "rp" indicates a "restricted pointer".

Dropped support for 16-bit platforms. The support for FAR/far types has
been eliminated and the definition of png_alloc_size_t is now controlled
by a flag so that 'small size_t' systems can select it if necessary.

Error detection in some chunks has improved; in particular the iCCP chunk
reader now does pretty complete validation of the basic format.  Some bad
profiles that were previously accepted are now accepted with a warning or
rejected, depending upon the <a href="png.h.html#L1844">png_set_benign_errors</a>() setting, in particular
the very old broken Microsoft/HP 3144-byte sRGB profile.  Starting with
libpng-1.6.11, recognizing and checking sRGB profiles can be avoided by
means of

    #if defined(<a href="png.h.html#L3237">PNG_SKIP_sRGB_CHECK_PROFILE</a>) &amp;&amp; \
        defined(PNG_SET_OPTION_SUPPORTED)
       <a href="png.h.html#L3253">png_set_option</a>(png_ptr, <a href="png.h.html#L3237">PNG_SKIP_sRGB_CHECK_PROFILE</a>,
           <a href="png.h.html#L3251">PNG_OPTION_ON</a>);
    #endif

It's not a good idea to do this if you are using the "simplified API",
which needs to be able to recognize sRGB profiles conveyed via the iCCP
chunk.

The PNG spec requirement that only grayscale profiles may appear in images
with color type 0 or 4 and that even if the image only contains gray pixels,
only RGB profiles may appear in images with color type 2, 3, or 6, is now
enforced.  The sRGB chunk is allowed to appear in images with any color type
and is interpreted by libpng to convey a one-tracer-curve gray profile or a
three-tracer-curve RGB profile as appropriate.

Libpng 1.5.x erroneously used /MD for Debug DLL builds; if you used the debug
builds in your app and you changed your app to use /MD you will need to
change it back to /MDd for libpng 1.6.x.

Prior to libpng-1.6.0 a warning would be issued if the iTXt chunk contained
an empty language field or an empty translated keyword.  Both of these
are allowed by the PNG specification, so these warnings are no longer issued.

The library now issues an error if the application attempts to set a
transform after it calls <a href="png.h.html#L1398">png_read_update_info</a>() or if it attempts to call
both <a href="png.h.html#L1398">png_read_update_info</a>() and <a href="png.h.html#L1395">png_start_read_image</a>() or to call either
of them more than once.

The default condition for benign_errors is now to treat benign errors as
warnings while reading and as errors while writing.

The library now issues a warning if both background processing and RGB to
gray are used when gamma correction happens. As with previous versions of
the library the results are numerically very incorrect in this case.

There are some minor arithmetic changes in some transforms such as
<a href="png.h.html#L1330">png_set_background</a>(), that might be detected by certain regression tests.

Unknown chunk handling has been improved internally, without any API change.
This adds more correct option control of the unknown handling, corrects
a pre-existing bug where the per-chunk 'keep' setting is ignored, and makes
it possible to skip IDAT chunks in the sequential reader.

The machine-generated configure files are no longer included in branches
libpng16 and later of the GIT repository.  They continue to be included
in the tarball releases, however.

Libpng-1.6.0 through 1.6.2 used the CMF bytes at the beginning of the IDAT
stream to set the size of the sliding window for reading instead of using the
default 32-kbyte sliding window size.  It was discovered that there are
hundreds of PNG files in the wild that have incorrect CMF bytes that caused
zlib to issue the "invalid distance too far back" error and reject the file.
Libpng-1.6.3 and later calculate their own safe CMF from the image dimensions,
provide a way to revert to the libpng-1.5.x behavior (ignoring the CMF bytes
and using a 32-kbyte sliding window), by using

    <a href="png.h.html#L3253">png_set_option</a>(png_ptr, <a href="png.h.html#L3236">PNG_MAXIMUM_INFLATE_WINDOW</a>,
        <a href="png.h.html#L3251">PNG_OPTION_ON</a>);

and provide a tool (contrib/tools/pngfix) for rewriting a PNG file while
optimizing the CMF bytes in its IDAT chunk correctly.

Libpng-1.6.0 and libpng-1.6.1 wrote uncompressed iTXt chunks with the wrong
length, which resulted in PNG files that cannot be read beyond the bad iTXt
chunk.  This error was fixed in libpng-1.6.3, and a tool (called
contrib/tools/png-fix-itxt) has been added to the libpng distribution.

Starting with libpng-1.6.17, the PNG_SAFE_LIMITS macro was eliminated
and safe limits are used by default (users who need larger limits
can still override them at compile time or run time, as described above).

The new limits are
                                default   spec limit
   png_user_width_max         1,000,000  2,147,483,647
   png_user_height_max        1,000,000  2,147,483,647
   png_user_chunk_cache_max         128  unlimited
   png_user_chunk_malloc_max  8,000,000  unlimited

Starting with libpng-1.6.18, a PNG_RELEASE_BUILD macro was added, which allows
library builders to control compilation for an installed system (a release build).
It can be set for testing debug or beta builds to ensure that they will compile
when the build type is switched to RC or STABLE. In essence this overrides the
<a href="png.h.html#L344">PNG_LIBPNG_BUILD_BASE_TYPE</a> definition which is not directly user controllable.

Starting with libpng-1.6.19, attempting to set an over-length PLTE chunk
is an error. Previously this requirement of the PNG specification was not
enforced, and the palette was always limited to 256 entries. An over-length
PLTE chunk found in an input PNG is silently truncated.

Starting with libpng-1.6.31, the eXIf chunk is supported. Libpng does not
attempt to decode the Exif profile; it simply returns a byte array
containing the profile to the calling application which must do its own
decoding.

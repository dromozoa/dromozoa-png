<h1>XIV. Source code repository</h1>

<pre>XV. Source code repository

Since about February 2009, version 1.2.34, libpng has been under "git" source
control.  The git repository was built from old libpng-x.y.z.tar.gz files
going back to version 0.70.  You can access the git repository (read only)
at

    https://github.com/glennrp/libpng or
    https://git.code.sf.net/p/libpng/code.git

or you can browse it with a web browser at

    https://github.com/glennrp/libpng or
    https://sourceforge.net/p/libpng/code/ci/libpng16/tree/

Patches can be sent to glennrp at users.sourceforge.net or to
png-mng-implement at lists.sourceforge.net or you can upload them to
the libpng bug tracker at

    https://libpng.sourceforge.io/

or as a "pull request" to

    https://github.com/glennrp/libpng/pulls

We also accept patches built from the tar or zip distributions, and
simple verbal discriptions of bug fixes, reported either to the
SourceForge bug tracker, to the png-mng-implement at lists.sf.net
mailing list, as github issues, or directly to glennrp.

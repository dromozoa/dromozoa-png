<h1>VIII. Changes to Libpng from version 0.88</h1>

<pre>VIII.  Changes to Libpng from version 0.88

It should be noted that versions of libpng later than 0.96 are not
distributed by the original libpng author, Guy Schalnat, nor by
Andreas Dilger, who had taken over from Guy during 1996 and 1997, and
distributed versions 0.89 through 0.96, but rather by another member
of the original PNG Group, Glenn Randers-Pehrson.  Guy and Andreas are
still alive and well, but they have moved on to other things.

The old libpng functions png_read_init(), png_write_init(),
png_info_init(), png_read_destroy(), and png_write_destroy() have been
moved to PNG_INTERNAL in version 0.95 to discourage their use.  These
functions will be removed from libpng version 1.4.0.

The preferred method of creating and initializing the libpng structures is
via the png_create_read_struct(), png_create_write_struct(), and
png_create_info_struct() because they isolate the size of the structures
from the application, allow version error checking, and also allow the
use of custom error handling routines during the initialization, which
the old functions do not.  The functions png_read_destroy() and
png_write_destroy() do not actually free the memory that libpng
allocated for these structs, but just reset the data structures, so they
can be used instead of <a href="png.h.html#L1447">png_destroy_read_struct</a>() and
<a href="png.h.html#L1451">png_destroy_write_struct</a>() if you feel there is too much system overhead
allocating and freeing the png_struct for each image read.

Setting the error callbacks via png_set_message_fn() before
png_read_init() as was suggested in libpng-0.88 is no longer supported
because this caused applications that do not use custom error functions
to fail if the png_ptr was not initialized to zero.  It is still possible
to set the error callbacks AFTER png_read_init(), or to change them with
<a href="png.h.html#L1602">png_set_error_fn</a>(), which is essentially the same function, but with a new
name to force compilation errors with applications that try to use the old
method.

Support for the sCAL, iCCP, iTXt, and sPLT chunks was added at libpng-1.0.6;
however, iTXt support was not enabled by default.

Starting with version 1.0.7, you can find out which version of the library
you are using at run-time:

   png_uint_32 libpng_vn = <a href="png.h.html#L932">png_access_version_number</a>();

The number libpng_vn is constructed from the major version, minor
version with leading zero, and release number with leading zero,
(e.g., libpng_vn for version 1.0.7 is 10007).

Note that this function does not take a png_ptr, so you can call it
before you've created one.

You can also check which version of png.h you used when compiling your
application:

   png_uint_32 application_vn = <a href="png.h.html#L352">PNG_LIBPNG_VER</a>;

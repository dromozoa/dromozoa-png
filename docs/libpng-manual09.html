<h1>IX. Changes to Libpng from version 1.0.x to 1.2.x</h1>

<pre>IX. Changes to Libpng from version 1.0.x to 1.2.x

Support for user memory management was enabled by default.  To
accomplish this, the functions png_create_read_struct_2(),
png_create_write_struct_2(), <a href="png.h.html#L1605">png_set_mem_fn</a>(), <a href="png.h.html#L1608">png_get_mem_ptr</a>(),
png_malloc_default(), and png_free_default() were added.

Support for the iTXt chunk has been enabled by default as of
version 1.2.41.

Support for certain MNG features was enabled.

Support for numbered error messages was added.  However, we never got
around to actually numbering the error messages.  The function
<a href="png.h.html#L2355">png_set_strip_error_numbers</a>() was added (Note: the prototype for this
function was inadvertently removed from png.h in PNG_NO_ASSEMBLER_CODE
builds of libpng-1.2.15.  It was restored in libpng-1.2.36).

The png_malloc_warn() function was added at libpng-1.2.3.  This issues
a <a href="png.h.html#L1790">png_warning</a> and returns NULL instead of aborting when it fails to
acquire the requested memory allocation.

Support for setting user limits on image width and height was enabled
by default.  The functions <a href="png.h.html#L2361">png_set_user_limits</a>(), <a href="png.h.html#L2363">png_get_user_width_max</a>(),
and <a href="png.h.html#L2365">png_get_user_height_max</a>() were added at libpng-1.2.6.

The <a href="png.h.html#L1251">png_set_add_alpha</a>() function was added at libpng-1.2.7.

The function <a href="png.h.html#L1052">png_set_expand_gray_1_2_4_to_8</a>() was added at libpng-1.2.9.
Unlike png_set_gray_1_2_4_to_8(), the new function does not expand the
tRNS chunk to alpha. The png_set_gray_1_2_4_to_8() function is
deprecated.

A number of macro definitions in support of runtime selection of
assembler code features (especially Intel MMX code support) were
added at libpng-1.2.0:

    PNG_ASM_FLAG_MMX_SUPPORT_COMPILED
    PNG_ASM_FLAG_MMX_SUPPORT_IN_CPU
    PNG_ASM_FLAG_MMX_READ_COMBINE_ROW
    PNG_ASM_FLAG_MMX_READ_INTERLACE
    PNG_ASM_FLAG_MMX_READ_FILTER_SUB
    PNG_ASM_FLAG_MMX_READ_FILTER_UP
    PNG_ASM_FLAG_MMX_READ_FILTER_AVG
    PNG_ASM_FLAG_MMX_READ_FILTER_PAETH
    PNG_ASM_FLAGS_INITIALIZED
    PNG_MMX_READ_FLAGS
    PNG_MMX_FLAGS
    PNG_MMX_WRITE_FLAGS
    PNG_MMX_FLAGS

We added the following functions in support of runtime
selection of assembler code features:

    png_get_mmx_flagmask()
    png_set_mmx_thresholds()
    png_get_asm_flags()
    png_get_mmx_bitdepth_threshold()
    png_get_mmx_rowbytes_threshold()
    png_set_asm_flags()

We replaced all of these functions with simple stubs in libpng-1.2.20,
when the Intel assembler code was removed due to a licensing issue.

These macros are deprecated:

    PNG_READ_TRANSFORMS_NOT_SUPPORTED
    PNG_PROGRESSIVE_READ_NOT_SUPPORTED
    PNG_NO_SEQUENTIAL_READ_SUPPORTED
    PNG_WRITE_TRANSFORMS_NOT_SUPPORTED
    PNG_READ_ANCILLARY_CHUNKS_NOT_SUPPORTED
    PNG_WRITE_ANCILLARY_CHUNKS_NOT_SUPPORTED

They have been replaced, respectively, by:

    PNG_NO_READ_TRANSFORMS
    PNG_NO_PROGRESSIVE_READ
    PNG_NO_SEQUENTIAL_READ
    PNG_NO_WRITE_TRANSFORMS
    PNG_NO_READ_ANCILLARY_CHUNKS
    PNG_NO_WRITE_ANCILLARY_CHUNKS

PNG_MAX_UINT was replaced with <a href="png.h.html#L649">PNG_UINT_31_MAX</a>.  It has been
deprecated since libpng-1.0.16 and libpng-1.2.6.

The function
    png_check_sig(sig, num)
was replaced with
    !<a href="png.h.html#L913">png_sig_cmp</a>(sig, 0, num)
It has been deprecated since libpng-0.90.

The function
    png_set_gray_1_2_4_to_8()
which also expands tRNS to alpha was replaced with
    <a href="png.h.html#L1052">png_set_expand_gray_1_2_4_to_8</a>()
which does not. It has been deprecated since libpng-1.0.18 and 1.2.9.

<h1>X. Changes to Libpng from version 1.0.x/1.2.x to 1.4.x</h1>

<pre>X. Changes to Libpng from version 1.0.x/1.2.x to 1.4.x

Private libpng prototypes and macro definitions were moved from
png.h and pngconf.h into a new pngpriv.h header file.

Functions <a href="png.h.html#L1813">png_set_benign_errors</a>(), <a href="png.h.html#L1804">png_benign_error</a>(), and
<a href="png.h.html#L1809">png_chunk_benign_error</a>() were added.

Support for setting the maximum amount of memory that the application
will allocate for reading chunks was added, as a security measure.
The functions <a href="png.h.html#L2368">png_set_chunk_cache_max</a>() and <a href="png.h.html#L2370">png_get_chunk_cache_max</a>()
were added to the library.

We implemented support for I/O states by adding png_ptr member io_state
and functions png_get_io_chunk_name() and <a href="png.h.html#L2412">png_get_io_state</a>() in pngget.c

We added <a href="png.h.html#L849">PNG_TRANSFORM_GRAY_TO_RGB</a> to the available high-level
input transforms.

Checking for and reporting of errors in the IHDR chunk is more thorough.

Support for global arrays was removed, to improve thread safety.

Some obsolete/deprecated macros and functions have been removed.

Typecasted NULL definitions such as
   #define png_voidp_NULL            (png_voidp)NULL
were eliminated.  If you used these in your application, just use
NULL instead.

The png_struct and info_struct members "trans" and "trans_values" were
changed to "trans_alpha" and "trans_color", respectively.

The obsolete, unused pnggccrd.c and pngvcrd.c files and related makefiles
were removed.

The PNG_1_0_X and PNG_1_2_X macros were eliminated.

The PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED macro was eliminated.

Many WIN32_WCE #ifdefs were removed.

The functions png_read_init(info_ptr), png_write_init(info_ptr),
png_info_init(info_ptr), png_read_destroy(), and png_write_destroy()
have been removed.  They have been deprecated since libpng-0.95.

The png_permit_empty_plte() was removed. It has been deprecated
since libpng-1.0.9.  Use <a href="png.h.html#L2340">png_permit_mng_features</a>() instead.

We removed the obsolete stub functions png_get_mmx_flagmask(),
png_set_mmx_thresholds(), png_get_asm_flags(),
png_get_mmx_bitdepth_threshold(), png_get_mmx_rowbytes_threshold(),
png_set_asm_flags(), and png_mmx_supported()

We removed the obsolete png_check_sig(), png_memcpy_check(), and
png_memset_check() functions.  Instead use !<a href="png.h.html#L913">png_sig_cmp</a>(), memcpy(),
and memset(), respectively.

The function png_set_gray_1_2_4_to_8() was removed. It has been
deprecated since libpng-1.0.18 and 1.2.9, when it was replaced with
<a href="png.h.html#L1052">png_set_expand_gray_1_2_4_to_8</a>() because the former function also
expanded any tRNS chunk to an alpha channel.

Macros for <a href="png.h.html#L2545">png_get_uint_16</a>, <a href="png.h.html#L2544">png_get_uint_32</a>, and <a href="png.h.html#L2546">png_get_int_32</a>
were added and are used by default instead of the corresponding
functions. Unfortunately,
from libpng-1.4.0 until 1.4.4, the <a href="png.h.html#L2545">png_get_uint_16</a> macro (but not the
function) incorrectly returned a value of type png_uint_32.

We changed the prototype for png_malloc() from
    png_malloc(png_structp png_ptr, png_uint_32 size)
to
    png_malloc(png_structp png_ptr, png_alloc_size_t size)

This also applies to the prototype for the user replacement malloc_fn().

The png_calloc() function was added and is used in place of
of "png_malloc(); memset();" except in the case in <a href="png.h.html#L2321">png_read_png</a>()
where the array consists of pointers; in this case a "for" loop is used
after the png_malloc() to set the pointers to NULL, to give robust.
behavior in case the application runs out of memory part-way through
the process.

We changed the prototypes of <a href="png.h.html#L933">png_get_compression_buffer_size</a>() and
<a href="png.h.html#L936">png_set_compression_buffer_size</a>() to work with size_t instead of
png_uint_32.

Support for numbered error messages was removed by default, since we
never got around to actually numbering the error messages. The function
<a href="png.h.html#L2355">png_set_strip_error_numbers</a>() was removed from the library by default.

The png_zalloc() and png_zfree() functions are no longer exported.
The png_zalloc() function no longer zeroes out the memory that it
allocates.  Applications that called png_zalloc(png_ptr, number, size)
can call png_calloc(png_ptr, number*size) instead, and can call
<a href="png.h.html#L1727">png_free</a>() instead of png_zfree().

Support for dithering was disabled by default in libpng-1.4.0, because
it has not been well tested and doesn't actually "dither".
The code was not
removed, however, and could be enabled by building libpng with
PNG_READ_DITHER_SUPPORTED defined.  In libpng-1.4.2, this support
was re-enabled, but the function was renamed <a href="png.h.html#L1328">png_set_quantize</a>() to
reflect more accurately what it actually does.  At the same time,
the PNG_DITHER_[RED,GREEN_BLUE]_BITS macros were also renamed to
PNG_QUANTIZE_[RED,GREEN,BLUE]_BITS, and PNG_READ_DITHER_SUPPORTED
was renamed to PNG_READ_QUANTIZE_SUPPORTED.

We removed the trailing '.' from the warning and error messages.

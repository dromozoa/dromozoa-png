<h1>II. Structures</h1>

<pre>II. Structures

There are two main structures that are important to libpng, png_struct
and png_info.  Both are internal structures that are no longer exposed
in the libpng interface (as of libpng 1.5.0).

The png_info structure is designed to provide information about the
PNG file.  At one time, the fields of png_info were intended to be
directly accessible to the user.  However, this tended to cause problems
with applications using dynamically loaded libraries, and as a result
a set of interface functions for png_info (the png_get_*() and png_set_*()
functions) was developed, and direct access to the png_info fields was
deprecated..

The png_struct structure is the object used by the library to decode a
single image.  As of 1.5.0 this structure is also not exposed.

Almost all libpng APIs require a pointer to a png_struct as the first argument.
Many (in particular the png_set and png_get APIs) also require a pointer
to png_info as the second argument.  Some application visible macros
defined in png.h designed for basic data access (reading and writing
integers in the PNG format) don't take a png_info pointer, but it's almost
always safe to assume that a (png_struct*) has to be passed to call an API
function.

You can have more than one png_info structure associated with an image,
as illustrated in pngtest.c, one for information valid prior to the
IDAT chunks and another (called "end_info" below) for things after them.

The png.h header file is an invaluable reference for programming with libpng.
And while I'm on the topic, make sure you include the libpng header file:

#include &lt;png.h&gt;

and also (as of libpng-1.5.0) the zlib header file, if you need it:

#include &lt;zlib.h&gt;

Types

The png.h header file defines a number of integral types used by the
APIs.  Most of these are fairly obvious; for example types corresponding
to integers of particular sizes and types for passing color values.

One exception is how non-integral numbers are handled.  For application
convenience most APIs that take such numbers have C (double) arguments;
however, internally PNG, and libpng, use 32 bit signed integers and encode
the value by multiplying by 100,000.  As of libpng 1.5.0 a convenience
macro <a href="png.h.html#L687">PNG_FP_1</a> is defined in png.h along with a type (png_fixed_point)
which is simply (png_int_32).

All APIs that take (double) arguments also have a matching API that
takes the corresponding fixed point integer arguments.  The fixed point
API has the same name as the floating point one with "_fixed" appended.
The actual range of values permitted in the APIs is frequently less than
the full range of (png_fixed_point) (-21474 to +21474).  When APIs require
a non-negative argument the type is recorded as png_uint_32 above.  Consult
the header file and the text below for more information.

Special care must be take with sCAL chunk handling because the chunk itself
uses non-integral values encoded as strings containing decimal floating point
numbers.  See the comments in the header file.

Configuration

The main header file function declarations are frequently protected by C
preprocessing directives of the form:

    #ifdef PNG_feature_SUPPORTED
    declare-function
    #endif
    ...
    #ifdef PNG_feature_SUPPORTED
    use-function
    #endif

The library can be built without support for these APIs, although a
standard build will have all implemented APIs.  Application programs
should check the feature macros before using an API for maximum
portability.  From libpng 1.5.0 the feature macros set during the build
of libpng are recorded in the header file "pnglibconf.h" and this file
is always included by png.h.

If you don't need to change the library configuration from the default, skip to
the next section ("Reading").

Notice that some of the makefiles in the 'scripts' directory and (in 1.5.0) all
of the build project files in the 'projects' directory simply copy
scripts/pnglibconf.h.prebuilt to pnglibconf.h.  This means that these build
systems do not permit easy auto-configuration of the library - they only
support the default configuration.

The easiest way to make minor changes to the libpng configuration when
auto-configuration is supported is to add definitions to the command line
using (typically) CPPFLAGS.  For example:

CPPFLAGS=-DPNG_NO_FLOATING_ARITHMETIC

will change the internal libpng math implementation for gamma correction and
other arithmetic calculations to fixed point, avoiding the need for fast
floating point support.  The result can be seen in the generated pnglibconf.h -
make sure it contains the changed feature macro setting.

If you need to make more extensive configuration changes - more than one or two
feature macro settings - you can either add -DPNG_USER_CONFIG to the build
command line and put a list of feature macro settings in pngusr.h or you can set
DFA_XTRA (a makefile variable) to a file containing the same information in the
form of 'option' settings.

A. Changing pnglibconf.h

A variety of methods exist to build libpng.  Not all of these support
reconfiguration of pnglibconf.h.  To reconfigure pnglibconf.h it must either be
rebuilt from scripts/pnglibconf.dfa using awk or it must be edited by hand.

Hand editing is achieved by copying scripts/pnglibconf.h.prebuilt to
pnglibconf.h and changing the lines defining the supported features, paying
very close attention to the 'option' information in scripts/pnglibconf.dfa
that describes those features and their requirements.  This is easy to get
wrong.

B. Configuration using DFA_XTRA

Rebuilding from pnglibconf.dfa is easy if a functioning 'awk', or a later
variant such as 'nawk' or 'gawk', is available.  The configure build will
automatically find an appropriate awk and build pnglibconf.h.
The scripts/pnglibconf.mak file contains a set of make rules for doing the
same thing if configure is not used, and many of the makefiles in the scripts
directory use this approach.

When rebuilding simply write a new file containing changed options and set
DFA_XTRA to the name of this file.  This causes the build to append the new file
to the end of scripts/pnglibconf.dfa.  The pngusr.dfa file should contain lines
of the following forms:

everything = off

This turns all optional features off.  Include it at the start of pngusr.dfa to
make it easier to build a minimal configuration.  You will need to turn at least
some features on afterward to enable either reading or writing code, or both.

option feature on
option feature off

Enable or disable a single feature.  This will automatically enable other
features required by a feature that is turned on or disable other features that
require a feature which is turned off.  Conflicting settings will cause an error
message to be emitted by awk.

setting feature default value

Changes the default value of setting 'feature' to 'value'.  There are a small
number of settings listed at the top of pnglibconf.h, they are documented in the
source code.  Most of these values have performance implications for the library
but most of them have no visible effect on the API.  Some can also be overridden
from the API.

This method of building a customized pnglibconf.h is illustrated in
contrib/pngminim/*.  See the "$(PNGCONF):" target in the makefile and
pngusr.dfa in these directories.

C. Configuration using PNG_USER_CONFIG

If -DPNG_USER_CONFIG is added to the CPPFLAGS when pnglibconf.h is built,
the file pngusr.h will automatically be included before the options in
scripts/pnglibconf.dfa are processed.  Your pngusr.h file should contain only
macro definitions turning features on or off or setting settings.

Apart from the global setting "everything = off" all the options listed above
can be set using macros in pngusr.h:

#define PNG_feature_SUPPORTED

is equivalent to:

option feature on

#define PNG_NO_feature

is equivalent to:

option feature off

#define PNG_feature value

is equivalent to:

setting feature default value

Notice that in both cases, pngusr.dfa and pngusr.h, the contents of the
pngusr file you supply override the contents of scripts/pnglibconf.dfa

If confusing or incomprehensible behavior results it is possible to
examine the intermediate file pnglibconf.dfn to find the full set of
dependency information for each setting and option.  Simply locate the
feature in the file and read the C comments that precede it.

This method is also illustrated in the contrib/pngminim/* makefiles and
pngusr.h.
